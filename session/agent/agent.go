// pane strings prove the agent is working, which mark a blocking prompt, which
// startup gates intercept keystrokes, and how a dead session is relaunched so it
// resumes its conversation. The tmux poller consumes an Adapter instead of
// branching on the program string, so supporting a new agent (or fixing a stale
// heuristic after a third-party TUI changes its wording) is a table edit plus a
// fixture test — never a change to the poll logic itself.
//
// The package is pure data and string matching: no tmux, no subprocesses, no IO.
// Pane capture and capability probes stay in session/tmux; matchers receive the
// cleaned full pane and confine themselves to its bottom chrome via the
// windowing helpers in chrome.go. Two exceptions take the RAW capture instead:
// GateUp, and SuggestionVisible — the latter because SGR dim styling is its
// entire signal (see suggestion.go).
