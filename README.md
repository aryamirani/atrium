Atrium is a terminal command center for orchestrating multiple AI coding agents — [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and other local agents including [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) — each in its own isolated git worktree, so you can drive several tasks at once from a single panel.

### Highlights
- Complete tasks in the background (including yolo / auto-accept mode!)
- Manage instances and tasks in one terminal window
- Review changes before applying them, pause sessions to pick their branches up elsewhere
- Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so no conflicts

<br />

### Installation

Atrium installs as `atrium` on your system. The installer also sets up `atr` as a short alias.

#### Quick install (curl)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZviBaratz/atrium/main/install.sh | bash
```

This puts the `atrium` binary in `~/.local/bin`. To use a custom name for the binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZviBaratz/atrium/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --name <your-binary-name>
```

#### go install

Requires Go 1.25 or newer (older toolchains fetch it automatically unless
`GOTOOLCHAIN=local` is set):

```bash
go install github.com/ZviBaratz/atrium@latest
```

#### Updating

```bash
atrium update          # download, verify, and install the latest release
atrium update --check  # just see whether one exists
```

Atrium also checks for new releases when it starts (cached: the network is
hit at most once a day, and at most once an hour after a failed check) and
shows a hint when one is available. The running app and your sessions are
never touched — an installed update takes effect the next time you start
`atrium`. Set `"auto_update": "auto"` in `config.json` to install updates
automatically in the background (auto mode may also check at startup while a
found update is still pending install), or `"off"` to disable the startup
check.
Source builds that are not at an exact release tag (`go install`, dev
checkouts) report a dev version and never self-update.

### Prerequisites

<b>Using Atrium with other AI assistants:</b>
- For [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex): Set your API key with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>`
- Launch with specific assistants:
   - Codex: `atrium -p "codex"`
   - Aider: `atrium -p "aider ..."`
   - Gemini: `atrium -p "gemini"`
- Make this the default, by modifying the config file (locate with `atrium debug`)

<br />

#### Menu
The menu at the bottom of the screen shows available commands:

##### Instance/Session Management
- `n` - Create a new session (form focused on the name)
- `N` - Create a new session (form focused on the project picker)
- `ctrl-x` - Kill the selected session (press twice to confirm)
- `↑/k`, `↓/j` - Navigate between sessions
- `/` - Filter sessions

##### Actions
- `↵/o` - Attach to the selected session
- `ctrl-q` - Toggle attach/detach (detach when attached, attach from the list)
- `s` - Send a message to the selected session without attaching
- `p` - Pause: commit changes and free the worktree
- `P` - Commit and push the session branch
- `r` - Resume a paused session
- `y` - Copy the session's branch name to the clipboard
- `?` - Show help menu

##### Navigation
- `tab` / `shift-tab` - Cycle the preview / diff / terminal panes
- `1` / `2` / `3` - Jump straight to a pane
- `shift-↓/↑` - Scroll the active pane
- `,` - Settings
- `q` - Quit the application

### Configuration

Atrium stores its configuration in `~/.atrium/config.json`. You can find the exact path by running `atrium debug`. Installs that predate the rename keep using their existing `~/.claude-squad` directory automatically.

#### Auto-attach

By default, Atrium attaches you to a new session as soon as it starts, so you land directly in the agent. Detach with `ctrl-q` to return to the session list. When you create a session with the `N` form and provide an initial prompt, auto-attach is skipped — the session stays in the list so the prompt is delivered automatically once the agent is ready, and you can attach with `↵`/`o` whenever you like.

To disable auto-attach and always return to the list after creating a session, set `auto_attach` to `false`:

```json
{
  "auto_attach": false
}
```

#### Auto-update

`auto_update` controls the startup release check: `"notify"` (default) shows a
hint when a newer release exists, `"auto"` downloads and installs it in the
background (applied on the next launch), and `"off"` disables the check. The
explicit `atrium update` command works regardless of this setting. Alongside
the transient hint, a persistent `⇡` badge in the Sessions panel border shows
the pending update (or restart) state until the next launch.

#### Notifications

Because each agent runs inside Atrium's own tmux server, an agent's own terminal
bell never reaches you — so Atrium can emit its own signal when a **background**
session finishes a turn or blocks on a prompt. `notifications` selects how:

- `"off"` (default) — no notifications.
- `"bell"` — rings the terminal bell once per edge on Atrium's own terminal.
- `"desktop"` — fires a desktop notification. With `notify_command` unset, Atrium
  uses a built-in per-OS notifier (`notify-send` on Linux, `terminal-notifier` or
  `osascript` on macOS); a missing notifier is a silent no-op.

The session you're currently on — the selected row, or one you're attached to —
never notifies, so only agents you've navigated away from can interrupt you.

```json
{
  "notifications": "desktop",
  "notify_command": "notify-send \"Atrium\" \"$ATRIUM_SESSION $ATRIUM_STATUS\""
}
```

`notify_command`, when set, runs via `sh -c` for each desktop notification with
`$ATRIUM_SESSION` (the session's display name), `$ATRIUM_STATUS`
(`Ready`/`NeedsInput`), and `$ATRIUM_EVENT` (`finished`/`needs_input`) in its
environment — the session name rides in the environment, never interpolated into
the command, so it can't break argument parsing. Use it for `terminal-notifier`,
webhooks (`curl`), or any custom notifier. A failing command is logged, never
fatal. Both settings are also editable live from the Settings panel (`,`).

#### Profiles

Profiles let you define multiple named program configurations and switch between them when creating a new session. When more than one profile is defined, the session creation overlay shows a profile picker that you can navigate with `←`/`→`.

On first run, Atrium probes for installed agent CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `aider`) and seeds a profile for each one it finds. After installing a new agent, run:

```bash
atrium profiles detect
```

to add it as a profile — existing profiles and your default program are never modified.

To configure profiles by hand, add a `profiles` array to your config file and set `default_program` to the name of the profile to select by default:

```json
{
  "default_program": "claude",
  "profiles": [
    { "name": "claude", "program": "claude" },
    { "name": "codex", "program": "codex" },
    { "name": "aider", "program": "aider --model ollama_chat/gemma3:1b" }
  ]
}
```

Each profile has two fields:

| Field     | Description                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`    | Display name shown in the profile picker                 |
| `program` | Shell command used to launch the agent for that profile  |

If no profiles are defined, Atrium uses `default_program` directly as the launch command (the default is `claude`).

#### Carried files

Git worktrees materialize only tracked files, so gitignored local config — most
commonly `.claude/settings.local.json` (hooks, output style, MCP allowlists) —
never reaches a fresh session worktree on its own. The `carry_files` list names
repo-relative gitignored files that Atrium copies from the original checkout
into each newly created session worktree:

```json
{
  "carry_files": [".claude/settings.local.json"]
}
```

The default is `[".claude/settings.local.json"]`; set an empty list (`[]`) to
opt out. Entries must be gitignored in the project — anything else is skipped
with a warning, because pausing a session commits its worktree and a
non-ignored file would leak into the session branch.

Carried files are re-seeded from the original checkout whenever the worktree
is created, including on resume after a pause — edits made to them inside a
session do not survive a pause/resume cycle.

#### Claude accounts

Route each session to a specific Claude Code account by injecting a per-session
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, chosen by matching the worktree's git `origin` remote (or, for
a non-git/direct session, its directory path). This is useful when different repos
must run under different Claude accounts (e.g. personal vs. work), since MCP
connectors and auth are stored per `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Add a `claude_accounts`
list to your config file:

```json
{
  "claude_accounts": [
    { "name": "personal", "config_dir": "~/.claude" },
    {
      "name": "quantivly",
      "config_dir": "~/.claude-quantivly",
      "remote_matches": ["quantivly/", "github-quantivly:"],
      "path_matches": ["/quantivly/"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `remote_matches` are case-insensitive substrings tested against the origin URL.
- `path_matches` are case-insensitive substrings tested against the target
  **directory path** — the routing signal for **direct (non-git) sessions** (which
  have no remote), such as a container directory that holds several repos but is not
  itself one, and also a route for git repos whose remote matches nothing.
- Matching is evaluated per account in list order (within an account, remote first
  then path); the first account that hits either rule wins. Because list order
  dominates, an earlier account's `path_matches` beats a later account's
  `remote_matches`.
- The **first account with no `remote_matches` and no `path_matches`** is the
  catch-all default, used when no route matches. It is optional: with no such
  account, non-matching sessions inherit the current environment.
- The resolved account is **pinned at session creation** and shown as a badge in
  the session list (dim for the default account, accented for a routed one). It
  is injected once at launch and is not re-resolved on restart or `--continue`;
  editing `claude_accounts` affects only newly created sessions.
- When more than one account is configured, the new-session form shows an
  **Account** picker, preset to the auto-routed account, to override the choice.
- Omitting `claude_accounts` disables the feature entirely (no badge, no
  injection), so existing configs are unaffected.

#### GitHub CLI accounts

`gh` keeps a single **global active account** per host, so in a multi-agent setup a
session on a work repo and a session on a personal repo fight over it — and an agent
running `gh auth switch` to fix its own auth silently breaks every other running
session. Atrium avoids this by injecting a per-session `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, chosen by the
same remote/path matching as `claude_accounts` but configured independently so gh
routing can differ from Claude-login routing. Add a `gh_accounts` list:

```json
{
  "gh_accounts": [
    { "name": "personal", "config_dir": "~/.config/gh" },
    {
      "name": "quantivly",
      "config_dir": "~/.config/gh-quantivly",
      "remote_matches": ["quantivly/", "github-quantivly:"],
      "path_matches": ["/quantivly/"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `config_dir` is a `gh` config directory (containing `hosts.yml`) whose **active
  account** is the one you want for matching repos. Create one per account, e.g.
  `GH_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gh-quantivly gh auth login`; when `gh` stores tokens in the
  OS keyring, the separate dirs share those tokens and differ only in which account is
  active. Verify with `GH_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gh-quantivly gh auth status`.
- Matching rules (`remote_matches`, `path_matches`, list order, the optional rule-less
  catch-all) work exactly as for `claude_accounts` above.
- The resolved dir is injected into the agent's tmux session (so the agent's own `gh`
  — and any HTTPS git credential-helper — pick the right account) **and** into
  Atrium's own `gh` calls (PR create/merge/view). It is pinned at session creation;
  editing `gh_accounts` affects only newly created sessions.
- Omitting `gh_accounts` (or a non-matching session with no catch-all) leaves `gh` on
  its ambient global account, exactly as before.

### FAQs

#### Failed to start new session

If you get an error like `failed to start new session: timed out waiting for tmux session`, update the
underlying program (ex. `claude`) to the latest version.

### Security & verifying releases

Releases ship with SLSA build provenance and a keyless Sigstore signature over
the checksums file, plus a per-archive SBOM. To confirm a download is genuine:

```bash
gh attestation verify atrium_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz --repo ZviBaratz/atrium
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full verification steps (including `cosign`)
and how to report a vulnerability privately.

### How It Works

1. **tmux** to create isolated terminal sessions for each agent
2. **git worktrees** to isolate codebases so each session works on its own branch
3. A simple TUI interface for easy navigation and management
