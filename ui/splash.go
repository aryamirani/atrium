// The empty-state splash: a slow-drifting field that appears to emanate from
// the ATRIUM wordmark and fades out at the pane's edges. The field is sampled
// per character cell from one of several generators (see splashVariant),
// modulated by a radial envelope, colored by a theme-anchored gradient, and
// composited *behind* the existing wordmark+message block (which is left
// untouched, so its styling survives). Only the idle "no agents" screen uses
// it; every other empty state keeps the plain FallbackBanner.
//
// This file owns the scene composition, the gradient LUT, and the emitter; the
// field math and the per-cell loops live in splash_field.go.
