// The adapter table. Each entry records one agent CLI's heuristics with the
// provenance of every string, so a future "agent X shows as always idle" report
// can be fixed by re-checking the cited source and editing the one stale entry.
//
// Heuristic strings are version-sensitive by nature. When editing, add a fixture
// to registry_test.go pinning the new string against a captured pane, and bump
// the adapter's VerifiedVersion to the version you captured against.
//
// Read VerifiedVersion as a RECORD of what was last driven against a live pane,
// not as a tripwire. The drift guard in internal/doctor only warns once an
// installed CLI passes the pin at the adapter's DriftGranularity, so for the
// minor-granularity adapters here every patch release inside the pinned minor
// series reports "ok" no matter how far it has moved. #332 was filed on the
// premise that `atrium doctor` was flagging installed 2.1.209 against a 2.1.207
// pin; it was not, and could not — both truncate to 2.1.0. Nothing tells you a
// heuristic went stale. Only driving it does.
//
// Remediation is ADDITIVE, never replace-in-place: when a CLI rewords a gating
// string, ADD the new variant alongside the old in the same matcher list and
// keep both through a deprecation window, e.g.
//   // claude >=2.1.180; "No, keep planning" kept for <2.1.180, remove after.
// A union match can't guess wrong (a pane shows only one variant), so matching
// never depends on the detected version. A plain re-verification (strings still
// valid at a newer release) is just a VerifiedVersion bump, no string edit.

	// Every heuristic below was driven against a live claude 2.1.210 pane in the #332
	// sweep (2026-07-15) — busy marker (at widths 200/60/56/30), live spinner, plan
	// approval, model-error, AskUserQuestion selection, folder-trust gate, all six
	// permission-mode footers, the "? for shortcuts" fall-through, the collapsed-paste
	// chip, the dim ghost-text suggestion, the --settings capability probe, and both
	// MCP-approval shapes. The one string a pane cannot show is the login-error separator
	// (reaching it means revoking auth); it was confirmed present in the 2.1.210 bundle
	// instead. #332 claimed the MCP titles were unreachable too — they are not, a
	// project-scoped .mcp.json renders them on demand, and #340 drove them. The
	// fetch/network dialog was the last shape never driven; #343 drove it (prompt a
	// session to WebFetch a fresh domain) at widths 100 and 28.
	//
	// The sweep exists because the pin is a claim about the WHOLE surface, and three times
	// now that claim was false at the version it named. #333 found the default footer
	// ("manual mode on") rendering on a live 2.1.207 pane the marker table did not know.
	// #332 then found the tool-permission matcher keyed on a literal that belongs only to
	// the fetch/network dialogs, so every Write/Edit/Bash approval read as idle — also
	// reproducing at 2.1.207. #343 then drove the fetch dialog that literal came from and
	// found the fixture describing it was invented: it renders NO footer, and it renders
	// the tool's own arguments inside itself, which is what made the literal forgeable.
	// None was newer-CLI drift; all were wrong at the pin. So re-verify by DRIVING each
	// heuristic, and treat "the string is still in the bundle" as necessary but not
	// sufficient — a literal can survive while nothing renders it, and the bundle cannot
	// tell you what surrounds it on screen.
	//
	// Minor granularity (matching gemini): claude ships patch releases every few days, so
	// patch-level drift would fire the warning almost constantly — alert fatigue, not
	// signal. A patch reword is already handled additively (both old and new variants kept
	// in the same matcher's union, so matching never depends on the version), and a missed
	// reword fails gracefully to "idle", never a wrong action. So only a minor/major bump —
	// where structural UI changes are likelier — counts as drift worth re-verifying. Note
	// the corollary the two misses above make concrete: within a minor series this pin
	// warns about nothing, so it is a record of what was checked, not a tripwire that will
	// tell you when to check again.

	// The below-box footer renders "esc to interrupt" while working. #308 read its
	// absence on a busy pane as a *responsive* hint area crowding the marker out at
	// narrow widths; that was wrong, and the sweep in #332 corrected it. The hint list
	// is built by plain concatenation with no width term and no priority — the interrupt
	// hint and the "ctrl+t to hide tasks" chip render together, so a chip never displaces
	// the marker. Confirmed live at 2.1.210: a busy pane keeps "esc to interrupt" intact
	// at widths 200, 60 and 56.
	//
	// Two real reasons the marker can still go missing on a working pane:
	//   - The footer gates it on the CLI's narrowest notion of busy. The bundle tracks
	//     isLoading / isExternalLoading / betweenCalls separately and only isLoading
	//     lights the hint, so a turn can be underway with no marker at all. That is the
	//     shape the #308 bug pane actually captured (session/tmux/spinner_poll_test.go).
	//   - The whole footer line is rendered with truncate-on-overflow, so a *narrow
	//     enough* pane cuts the tail off mid-word — at width 30 a busy 2.1.210 pane
	//     reads "⏸ manual mode on · esc to …", losing the marker. This is one composed
	//     line overflowing, not hint selection: the hint is present, just clipped.
	// Both fail safe — a missing marker reads idle, never a wrong action — and the live
	// spinner below covers them, so the marker stays a valid positive signal.
	BusyMarkers:  []string{"esc to interrupt"},
	MarkerWindow: 0, // status hints render below the input box border

	// The above-box spinner status line ("<glyph> <Gerund>… (<elapsed> · …)") proves work
	// when the footer marker is absent (spinner.go). It survives both causes above: it
	// tracks a broader notion of busy than the interrupt hint, and its signature sits at
	// the head of its own line, where truncation reaches last.

// pinned by every captured shape (registry_test.go claudeTrustPane, claudeMCPSinglePane,

// gated pane is the dialog's own top rule and everything below it IS the dialog, while on a
// running session the last border is the composer's bottom edge and everything below it is
// just the footer. That asymmetry is the whole signal, and it is the one footerBelowBox was
// written for: "a caller that must not false-match a phrase quoted in the conversation".
//
// Why not the flat window it replaces: only ~5 lines of live chrome sit below the composer,
// so a bottom-15 window always also holds the tail of the transcript, and a session merely
// discussing these titles read as blocked — with the row stuck on "waiting on setup screen"
// and, because PaneGate also gates prompt delivery (session/tmux AwaitingInput), its queued
// prompt silently never sent. Tightening the literals cannot fix that: the sessions that hit
// it quote the titles verbatim, being about this file.
//
// Why not the segment scan the prompt matchers use (footerVisibleInSegments): its input-box
// stop only fires on a segment whose FIRST line is the composer, so a live permission dialog
// — whose segment opens with its own title — lets the scan walk on into the transcript. The
// border anchor does not walk, and it puts no floor under the region, so a title reconstructs
// however tall the dialog reflows (claudeMCPWrappedPane, claudeMCPNarrowPane).
//
// What the anchor does NOT prove, bounded here rather than assumed away:
//
//   - That anything sits below the rule at all. footerBelowBox reports ok=true for a pane
//     whose LAST line is the rule, handing back an empty region: ok means "an anchor exists",
//     not "the region is meaningful". Keying the fallback on ok alone would match "" and go
//     silent — a MISSED gate — so an empty region falls back too.
//   - That the rule is live chrome. Removing the floor must not remove the ceiling with it,
//     or transcript below a rule the agent printed itself matches instead: see gateRegionCap.
//
// Either fallback lands on the flat window, which is today's behavior, kept because ITS

//
// Known limit, accepted: a rule rendered BELOW a live dialog steals the anchor, and the gate
// is missed. A custom statusLine drawing its own ─── is the shape chrome.go names (it is why

//   - Here the fallback could only ever hurt. Every borderless claude pane is one where no
//     dialog can be up — a pre-box boot frame, a --continue replay before the box paints, a
//     degenerate capture — because every captured dialog carries its own top rule. So the
//     flat window has no miss to rescue on such a pane, and one real false positive to
//     cause: a --continue replay of an Atrium session's transcript quotes these literals
//     while no box has painted yet.
//
// The known limit inherited from the anchor — a rule rendered BELOW a live dialog steals it
// (a custom statusLine's own ───, the shape chrome.go names) — costs a missed dialog. The
// choice above does not bear on it either way: a stolen anchor reports ok=true with the wrong
// region, so a fallback keyed on !ok would never fire for it. The cost is not symmetric:
//
//   - For permission a miss is one Enter autoyes does not send. The human taps it: safe.
//   - For permission-network/permission-local a miss reads as idle, and idle is what lets a
//     queued prompt be typed into the live dialog (permission-network above; session/tmux
//     AwaitingInput takes the dialog's "❯ 1. Yes" for a composer). That is the gate's
//     dangerous direction, not a safe one.
//
// Accepted on the same ground claudeGateVisible accepts it, not on fail-safety: no captured
// dialog renders a rule below itself — they replace the composer rather than sit above it — so
// there is no pane to pin it from. Revisit if one is ever captured. The segment scan is not
// the escape hatch here, for the reason claudeGateVisible gives: its input-box stop never
// fires on a dialog's own segment, so it walks on into the transcript.

// claudeFetchPermissionVisible backs the claude "permission" matcher — the only prompt
// autoyes answers with Enter, so it is written to fire on the fetch dialog and nothing else.
//
// Two conditions, each doing one job, because #343 proved one is not enough:
//
//   - The region must be live chrome (claudeLiveDialogRegion). This is what stops the
//     reported bug: the literals live verbatim in this file, so an agent working on Atrium
//     prints them, and on an idle pane — which never scrolls — a flat bottom-N match stuck
//     at needs-input until a human typed, with autoyes tapping Enter into the composer.
//
//   - The region's LAST question must be the fetch title. The anchor alone cannot do this,
//     and that is the sharper half of #343: claude renders a tool's own arguments inside the
//     approval dialog, BELOW its top rule, so `grep "No, and tell Claude what to do
//     differently"` forges the old key inside live chrome and autoyes approved the shell
//     command (claudeBashForgedPane, captured live). Body text is not transcript; no anchor
//     separates it. Position does: every captured dialog renders its body ABOVE its
//     question, so the LAST "Do you want to …" on the pane is always the dialog's own, and a
//     forged title in a Bash command or an Edit diff is never it. The Bash dialog's real
//     question is "Do you want to proceed?", so it falls through to permission-local and
//     surfaces as needs-input instead of being tapped.
//
// LastIndex over the FLATTENED region, not a per-line scan: at width 28 the title reflows
// across three physical lines ("Do you want to allow" / "Claude to fetch this" / "content?"
// — claudeFetchNarrowPane), and only flattening reconstructs it.
//
// Residual, accepted and unpinnable: text rendered BELOW a dialog's own question would
// forge the title. No captured dialog does that — the question always sits last, directly
// above the options — so there is no pane to pin it from. It also needs a filename or an
