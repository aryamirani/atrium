// Pending reconciliation (#290 Phase 2).
//
// A session enters Pending when the poller sees the hook record latched "ready" with a
// non-empty in-flight sub-agent set: the main turn ended, but background work is still
// outstanding. Pending is advisory — it must never become a permanently-stuck row — so it
// is reconciled in a strict, load-bearing priority order:
//
//  1. Explicit terminal status, gated on the set being empty. A Stop with the set empty is
//     the ONLY thing that yields done/idle (handled in poll.go: ready+empty → PaneIdle →
//     Ready). A Stop with the set non-empty is Pending, never done. Never inferred from
//     silence or a stale pane.
//  2. Wall-clock watchdog (this file). A session held Pending past a generous, agent-tunable
//     cap is force-reconciled to done EVEN IF the pane is still alive — the alive-but-stuck
//     case, where a SubagentStop never fired so the set never drained. Checked before
//     liveness precisely because liveness would answer "alive → keep waiting" and never time
//     it out. The cap is generous because a background sub-agent legitimately runs long;
//     liveness (below) carries the common, fast failure.
//  3. Liveness. A dead tmux pane is caught by Poll's has-session check (→ PaneDead →
//     recoverLostInstances → Paused) before the record is ever read, so a crash mid-sub-agent
//     can't strand a Pending row. This needs no code here — it is the existing machinery.
//  4. Freshness (heartbeat). A hook heartbeat now HOLDS working while fresh (poll.go, #311),
//     but only for the empty-set case — it never reconciles Pending and never declares
//     done/dead (that stays with 1–3 above). So it does not affect this order: a non-empty
//     set is still Pending regardless of heartbeat freshness. `working_stale`/keepalive
//     remain unbuilt (the animation-gated spinner already covers a long silent tool).
//
// Two invariants keep this free of the #46 oscillation: "done" is only ever an explicit
// ready with an empty set (never inferred), and the watchdog's reconciliation
// DETERMINISTICALLY clears the stuck set (ClearInflight) so the next poll sees ready+empty
// → idle and stays there, instead of re-classifying ready+non-empty → Pending and flapping.

// defaultPendingWatchdog is the wall-clock cap a session may sit Pending before the
// watchdog force-reconciles it to done. Deliberately generous: this backstops only the
// rare alive-but-stuck case (a SubagentStop that never fired on a still-live pane) — tmux
// liveness already catches the common dead-pane failure within a couple of ticks — so the
// cap is tuned so a legitimately long-running background sub-agent never trips it (a false
// "done" is worse than a row that reads "busy" a while longer). A var, not a const, so
// tests can shrink it. Agents may override via agent.Adapter.PendingWatchdog.
var defaultPendingWatchdog = 30 * time.Minute

// pendingWatchdogCap is this instance's Pending cap: the agent's override when set,
// otherwise the package default. Mirrors idleConfirmCap's adapter-override pattern.
func (i *Instance) pendingWatchdogCap() time.Duration {
	if d := agent.Resolve(i.Program).PendingWatchdog; d > 0 {
		return d
	}
	return defaultPendingWatchdog
}

// applyPending maps a PanePending poll onto the instance's status, running the wall-clock
// watchdog. On entry (status not yet Pending) it just latches Pending, resetting
// statusChangedAt so the cap measures pending-duration and not the prior state's age. On a
// subsequent poll where the session has been Pending longer than its cap, it reconciles:
// clear the stuck in-flight set (the deterministic latch-clear that prevents re-entry), then
// commit Ready. The commit flags unread like any real completion, so a session that was
// stuck pending surfaces as finished-and-unseen rather than silently vanishing.
func (i *Instance) applyPending() {
	if i.pendingExpired() {
		if ts := i.tmux(); ts != nil {
			// Clear the set before committing done so the next poll reads ready+empty → idle
			// and stays (the anti-oscillation clear). A persistent clear failure (broken FS)
			// degrades to a bounded re-reconcile — the row flips back to Pending next poll and
			// the watchdog retries a cap later — never a permanently-stuck row.
			if err := ts.ClearInflight(); err != nil {
				log.WarningLog.Printf("pending watchdog: failed to clear in-flight set for %q: %v", i.Title, err)
			}
		}
		i.SetStatus(Ready)
		log.InfoLog.Printf("pending watchdog: %q held pending past %s, reconciled to ready", i.Title, i.pendingWatchdogCap())
		return
	}
	i.SetStatus(Pending)
}

// pendingExpired reports whether the instance has been continuously Pending longer than
// its watchdog cap. Gated on the CURRENT status already being Pending: on the tick that
// first enters Pending the status is still the prior state (with an older statusChangedAt
// that must not be mistaken for a long pending hold), so the watchdog can only fire once
// the session has actually been Pending across at least one poll.
func (i *Instance) pendingExpired() bool {
	return i.GetStatus() == Pending && time.Since(i.StatusChangedAt()) > i.pendingWatchdogCap()
