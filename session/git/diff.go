// the worktree is clean — needless churn that also races the agent's own git operations
// on the shared index. This first lists untracked paths with a read-only
// `git ls-files --others` and only runs `add -N` when there is something to add, so the
// common steady state costs one read-only tree walk and no index write.
//
// ls-files (rather than parsing `git status`) is deliberate: it is not affected by
// `status.showUntrackedFiles`, so new files still surface even when the user has
// configured `git status` to hide untracked files — matching the original `add .`, which
// ignored that setting (a status-based scan would silently drop them). `--exclude-standard`
// applies .gitignore/exclude exactly like `add -N .` did, and `--directory` collapses a
// wholly-untracked directory to a single `dir/` entry that `add -N -- dir/` recurses into,
// bounding the argument list.
//
// It is best-effort and never blocks the diff: on failure the untracked files are simply
// absent from this tick (tracked changes still render) and the next poll retries. In
// particular `add -N` is allowed to fail silently on the common race where the agent
