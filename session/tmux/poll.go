// snapshot — same input box and footer, differing only by the "esc to interrupt" substring
// — so the marker alone can't tell "done" from "about to continue". The discriminator is
// motion: a finished pane freezes, whereas a between-turns pane keeps repainting (spinner
// elapsed ticking, output rendering, the next response streaming in).
//
//   - idleSettleTicks: once the marker is gone AND the cleaned content has been unchanged
//     for this many ticks, the pane has settled — commit to idle promptly (~1s). This is
//     the common path and keeps the "ready" indicator responsive on real completion.
//   - idleConfirmTicks: a safety cap. If the marker stays absent for this long even while
//     the pane keeps changing (an agent UI we don't model, or a missed marker), commit
//     anyway rather than holding "working" forever (~3s).
//
// A churning turn-boundary gap never satisfies idleSettleTicks (the pane is moving), so it
// holds "working" until the marker returns — no Ready→Running flicker. Prompts are surfaced
// instantly via detectPrompt regardless of either threshold. Both also govern the
// content-change fallback (aider/gemini): there "unchanged" is the same signal as "not
// working", so idleSettleTicks absorbs brief streaming pauses.
