// The splash field generator: deterministic noise primitives and the two-pass
// renderer built on them. Pass 1 evaluates the raw (pre-contrast,
// pre-envelope) scalar field into a buffer; Pass 2 applies contrast, the
// envelopes (edge vignette, radial dim, breathing), glyph and color
// quantization, the starfield, and emits run-coalesced ANSI. Everything is
// free of time/rand dependence so renderSplashField stays pure and
// snapshot-testable — animation enters only through the frame counter.
//
// The scene composition (wordmark/message overlay, clearing, gradient LUT)
// lives in splash.go; this file owns the field math and the per-cell loops.
