// Package daemon implements autoyes mode as a separate background process (not
// a goroutine): the TUI launches `atrium --daemon`, which polls all stored
// instances and taps Enter on pending prompts, and the TUI kills it again on
// startup and exit.
//
// The daemon is a strict fill-the-gap process: it runs only while no TUI is
// alive. The TUI kills any daemon before app.Run (main.go) and relaunches one
// only on exit, and the TUI is the sole creator of sessions — so no process
// adds sessions during the daemon's lifetime in the supported single-TUI
// workflow. The daemon therefore snapshots the instance list once at startup
// and treats that snapshot as authoritative for its whole (short) life; newly
// created sessions are picked up automatically at the next relaunch, not via an
// in-daemon refresh. See the RunDaemon load site for the invariant in full.
