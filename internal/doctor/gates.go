package doctor

// Remote feature-gate reporting. `atrium doctor`'s version check answers "which
// build is installed"; this answers "which BRANCH of that build renders". Claude
// ships two footer implementations in one binary and picks between them on a
// server-resolved gate, so the pane can change with no version change at all —
// drift the version check structurally cannot see (#337).
//
// The values are readable because claude persists every gate it resolves to
// <config dir>/.claude.json under cachedGrowthBookFeatures, rewriting the map from
// its in-memory payload on every fetch. That makes the file a faithful,
// eventually-consistent mirror of what the CLI actually resolved.
//
// One edge is documented rather than handled: with DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK set, claude
// short-circuits gate resolution and every gate takes its LOCAL default, ignoring
// the file. For tengu_copper_thistle that default is false — the value we pin — so
// the edge can only make this read pessimistic (a spurious "flipped"), never
// falsely reassuring. That is the safe direction for a report, and special-casing
// an env var that doctor sees but a session may not would be guessing.
//
// Like VerifiedVersion, this is a RECORD, not a tripwire that acts: nothing polls
// it and nothing in the TUI consumes it. See the "Why the TUI is untouched" note
// below CheckGatesInstalled.

// with a config_dir of its own keeps its row, so a reader finds the state under
// the name they routed sessions to rather than having to know which accounts
// share a dir. Two accounts on one dir therefore report it twice (same dir, same
// value, two names) — an absurd config, but the honest rendering of it, and one
// extra read of one small file.
//
// The lone dedupe is against defaultAccount, which is the one label here the user
// did NOT configure: it is a stand-in for "whatever dir an unrouted session
// inherits", so the moment a real account names that dir the stand-in has nothing
// left to say and yields its row. Only the first such account claims it; a second
// gets its own row like any other.
//
// The rule says "named a config dir" and not "configured" because an inherit-env
// account (config_dir "") names none: it injects nothing, so it reads whatever an
// unrouted session inherits and has no dir of its own to report. It rides the
// ambient row and is skipped here — which means it is reported under whatever name
// that row ends up carrying, "default" or the first account to claim it, never its
// own. Only a label is ever wrong: the dir read, and so the value, is the one that
// account's sessions actually see either way.
//
// Comparison is by CLEANED path, because the two spellings meeting here come from
// different places — doctor's own env and a hand-written config_dir — and a
// trailing slash is not a different dir. Cleaning happens here rather than in
