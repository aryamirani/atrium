// all" rather than "Esc to cancel". The bundle's token table for this dialog reads
// "space select · enter confirm", which is not the rendered line — the standing reminder
// that the table enumerates, only a probe renders.
//
// Width used to be load-bearing here, and #340's measurement is kept because it is what
// justified the rewrite rather than because it still binds: these titles sit ~8 lines up
// behind a prose paragraph that reflows, so narrowing the pane grew that paragraph and walked

// and fell outside the 15-line budget; the gate read nothing and an MCP-blocked session read
// Ready.
//
// That width is REACHABLE, and the tempting reading — "no working terminal is 28 columns" —
// is a category error worth spelling out, because it is what kept this miss filed as
// theoretical. The pane is not the terminal. session/instance.go SetPreviewSize sizes each
// agent's detached tmux session to the PREVIEW pane, precisely so captured content wraps the
// way it renders, and that pane is the terminal minus the session list minus two 2-column
// frames. The split is user-adjustable (< / >, mouse drag) to config.maxListRatio = 0.60 and
// persisted in state.json, so it survives restarts. Measured by driving the real layout
// (ui.TabbedWindow SetSize → GetPreviewSize) rather than re-deriving its arithmetic:
//
//	term=80 ratio=0.60 → preview=28    term=100 ratio=0.60 → preview=36
