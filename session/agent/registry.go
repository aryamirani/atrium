// The adapter table. Each entry records one agent CLI's heuristics with the
// provenance of every string, so a future "agent X shows as always idle" report
// can be fixed by re-checking the cited source and editing the one stale entry.
//
// Heuristic strings are version-sensitive by nature. When editing, add a fixture
// to registry_test.go pinning the new string against a captured pane, and bump
// the adapter's VerifiedVersion to the version you captured against.
//
// Read VerifiedVersion as a RECORD of what was last driven against a live pane,
// not as a tripwire. The drift guard in internal/doctor only warns once an
// installed CLI passes the pin at the adapter's DriftGranularity, so for the
// minor-granularity adapters here every patch release inside the pinned minor
// series reports "ok" no matter how far it has moved. #332 was filed on the
// premise that `atrium doctor` was flagging installed 2.1.209 against a 2.1.207
// pin; it was not, and could not — both truncate to 2.1.0. Nothing tells you a
// heuristic went stale. Only driving it does.
//
// A version pin also can't express everything that moves. Claude picks between two
// footer implementations in one binary on a server-resolved feature gate, so the
// rendered UI can change with NO version change at all — and because Atrium routes
// sessions to a per-account CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, two sessions on the same claude
// version can resolve that gate differently and render differently. VerifiedGates
// records which branch a capture came from; `atrium doctor` reads the value claude
// last resolved per account and reports a mismatch. So provenance here names a
// version AND a gate state: every capture in this file is an UNGATED capture.
//
// Remediation is ADDITIVE, never replace-in-place: when a CLI rewords a gating
// string, ADD the new variant alongside the old in the same matcher list and
// keep both through a deprecation window, e.g.
//   // claude >=2.1.180; "No, keep planning" kept for <2.1.180, remove after.
// A union match can't guess wrong (a pane shows only one variant), so matching
// never depends on the detected version. A plain re-verification (strings still
// valid at a newer release) is just a VerifiedVersion bump, no string edit.

// Claude Code. The reference adapter: every heuristic here predates this package
// and is pinned by the poll tests in session/tmux.

	// Every heuristic below was driven against a live claude 2.1.210 pane in the #332
	// sweep (2026-07-15) — busy marker (at widths 200/60/56/30), live spinner, plan
	// approval, model-error, AskUserQuestion selection, folder-trust gate, all six
	// permission-mode footers, the "? for shortcuts" fall-through, the collapsed-paste
	// chip, the dim ghost-text suggestion, the --settings capability probe, and both
	// MCP-approval shapes. The one string a pane cannot show is the login-error separator
	// (reaching it means revoking auth); it was confirmed present in the 2.1.210 bundle
	// instead. #332 claimed the MCP titles were unreachable too — they are not, a
	// project-scoped .mcp.json renders them on demand, and #340 drove them.
	//
	// The sweep exists because the pin is a claim about the WHOLE surface, and twice now
	// that claim was false at the version it named. #333 found the default footer
	// ("manual mode on") rendering on a live 2.1.207 pane the marker table did not know.
	// #332 then found the tool-permission matcher keyed on a literal that belongs only to
	// the fetch/network dialogs, so every Write/Edit/Bash approval read as idle — also
	// reproducing at 2.1.207. Neither was newer-CLI drift; both were wrong at the pin. So
	// re-verify by DRIVING each heuristic, and treat "the string is still in the bundle"
	// as necessary but not sufficient — a literal can survive while nothing renders it.
	//
	// Minor granularity (matching gemini): claude ships patch releases every few days, so
	// patch-level drift would fire the warning almost constantly — alert fatigue, not
	// signal. A patch reword is already handled additively (both old and new variants kept
	// in the same matcher's union, so matching never depends on the version), and a missed
	// reword fails gracefully to "idle", never a wrong action. So only a minor/major bump —
	// where structural UI changes are likelier — counts as drift worth re-verifying. Note
	// the corollary the two misses above make concrete: within a minor series this pin
	// warns about nothing, so it is a record of what was checked, not a tripwire that will
	// tell you when to check again.

	// The footer's implementation is chosen by this gate, not by the version. The
	// ungated branch (false) builds a hint LIST — hints concatenate, and "? for
	// shortcuts" is pushed only when the list is otherwise empty. The gated branch is
	// the single mutually-exclusive slot #333 described and mistook for ours. Live
	// 2.1.210 resolves false, proven by a co-occurrence the slot branch cannot produce:
	// "⏸ manual mode on · ? for shortcuts · ← for agents" carries the shortcuts hint
	// and the agents hint at once. Every capture pinned in this package is therefore an
	// UNGATED capture, and this field is what says so.
	//
	// What a flip would do to detection is NOT known, and cannot be found out here.
	// The gated branch is the one heuristic-relevant surface in this file that cannot
	// be driven at 2.1.210: the CLAUDE_INTERNAL_FC_OVERRIDES parse is dead code (A1r
	// returns before it reads the env var) and the in-memory payload beats the on-disk
	// map, so there is no supported way to make a pane render it. #337 read the gated
	// source and expects "<label> on" and "esc to interrupt" to survive, which would
	// leave BusyMarkers and the mode table spanning both branches — but that is a
	// bundle reading of a branch nobody has rendered, and this file's own rule is that
	// bundle presence is necessary and not sufficient. It is not a reason to skip
	// re-verifying. (Sharpening the point: "esc to interrupt" is not even a contiguous
	// literal in the 2.1.210 binary — it is assembled at runtime — so grepping for it
	// proves nothing in either direction, on either branch.)
	//
	// Detecting a flip is therefore what we get instead of auditing for one, and why
	// this is a pin rather than a comment — see internal/doctor/gates.go.
	VerifiedGates: []VerifiedGate{{Name: "tengu_copper_thistle", Value: false}},

	// The below-box footer renders "esc to interrupt" while working. #308 read its
	// absence on a busy pane as a *responsive* hint area crowding the marker out at
	// narrow widths; that was wrong, and the sweep in #332 corrected it. The hint list
	// is built by plain concatenation with no width term and no priority — the interrupt
	// hint and the "ctrl+t to hide tasks" chip render together, so a chip never displaces
	// the marker. Confirmed live at 2.1.210: a busy pane keeps "esc to interrupt" intact
	// at widths 200, 60 and 56.
	//
	// Two real reasons the marker can still go missing on a working pane:
	//   - The footer gates it on the CLI's narrowest notion of busy. The bundle tracks
	//     isLoading / isExternalLoading / betweenCalls separately and only isLoading
	//     lights the hint, so a turn can be underway with no marker at all. That is the
	//     shape the #308 bug pane actually captured (session/tmux/spinner_poll_test.go).
	//   - The whole footer line is rendered with truncate-on-overflow, so a *narrow
	//     enough* pane cuts the tail off mid-word — at width 30 a busy 2.1.210 pane
	//     reads "⏸ manual mode on · esc to …", losing the marker. This is one composed
	//     line overflowing, not hint selection: the hint is present, just clipped.
	// Both fail safe — a missing marker reads idle, never a wrong action — and the live
	// spinner below covers them, so the marker stays a valid positive signal.

	// the head of its own line, where truncation reaches last.

// pinned by every captured shape (registry_test.go claudeTrustPane, claudeMCPSinglePane,

// gated pane is the dialog's own top rule and everything below it IS the dialog, while on a
// running session the last border is the composer's bottom edge and everything below it is
// just the footer. That asymmetry is the whole signal, and it is the one footerBelowBox was
// written for: "a caller that must not false-match a phrase quoted in the conversation".
//
// Why not the flat window it replaces: only ~5 lines of live chrome sit below the composer,
// so a bottom-15 window always also holds the tail of the transcript, and a session merely
// discussing these titles read as blocked — with the row stuck on "waiting on setup screen"
// and, because PaneGate also gates prompt delivery (session/tmux AwaitingInput), its queued
// prompt silently never sent. Tightening the literals cannot fix that: the sessions that hit
// it quote the titles verbatim, being about this file.
//
// Why not the segment scan the prompt matchers use (footerVisibleInSegments): its input-box
// stop only fires on a segment whose FIRST line is the composer, so a live permission dialog
// — whose segment opens with its own title — lets the scan walk on into the transcript. The
// border anchor does not walk, and it puts no floor under the region, so a title reconstructs
// however tall the dialog reflows (claudeMCPWrappedPane, claudeMCPNarrowPane).
//
// What the anchor does NOT prove, bounded here rather than assumed away:
//
//   - That anything sits below the rule at all. footerBelowBox reports ok=true for a pane
//     whose LAST line is the rule, handing back an empty region: ok means "an anchor exists",
//     not "the region is meaningful". Keying the fallback on ok alone would match "" and go
//     silent — a MISSED gate — so an empty region falls back too.
//   - That the rule is live chrome. Removing the floor must not remove the ceiling with it,
//     or transcript below a rule the agent printed itself matches instead: see gateRegionCap.
//
// Either fallback lands on the flat window, which is today's behavior, kept because ITS
// failure is a false positive (needs-input on a live session), never a missed gate — and it
// is unreachable for the bug above, which needs a composer on screen, which is itself drawn

// aiderConfirmVisible backs the aider "confirm" matcher. Every confirm_ask

// "/(A)ll" (group, not explicit-yes), "/(S)kip all" (group), "/(D)on't ask
// again" (allow_never), and blocks at a trailing " [Yes]: "/" [No]: " default
// suffix. Two conditions, each doing one job:
//
//   - The "(Y)es"+"(N)o" pair anywhere in the flattened window covers every
//     option shape. Matching two tokens (not the contiguous "(Y)es/(N)o")
//     keeps a hard terminal wrap mid-run from defeating the match:
//     flattenChrome joins physical lines with a space.
//   - The last non-empty line must end with "]:" — the default suffix where
//     confirm_ask parks its cursor while blocked. This is the liveness
//     anchor: an answered confirm ("… [Yes]: y", or with output printed
//     below) and displayed content that merely mentions both tokens above
//     the "> " composer do not match, because something other than the
//     suffix ends the pane.
//
// The anchor is the bare "]:" rather than "[Yes]:"/"[No]:" to stay as
// wrap-tolerant as the token pair: of the possible wrap points inside the
// suffix, most leave a "]:"-tailed fragment as the last line, while the full
// bracket run survives none of them. Residual race, accepted: after an
// accept, the suffix line stays bottom-most until aider's next output lands,
// so a poll tick in that sub-second gap can still tap one extra Enter — with
// autoyes it accepts the next confirm's default, the intended semantics.
