Atrium is a terminal command center for orchestrating multiple AI coding agents — [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and other local agents including [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) — each in its own isolated git worktree, so you can drive several tasks at once from a single panel.

### Highlights
- Complete tasks in the background (including yolo / auto-accept mode!)
- Manage instances and tasks in one terminal window
- Review changes before applying them, pause sessions to pick their branches up elsewhere
- Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so no conflicts

### Demos

Per-flow screencasts — create→attach→detach, diff review, pause/resume — are
generated from committed [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) tapes in
[`docs/demos/`](docs/demos/). Render them with `just gifs`; they are deliberately
slow-paced so each step is followable.

<br />

### Installation

Atrium installs as `atrium` on your system. The installer also sets up `atr` as a short alias.

#### Quick install (curl)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZviBaratz/atrium/main/install.sh | bash
```

This puts the `atrium` binary in `~/.local/bin`. To use a custom name for the binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZviBaratz/atrium/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --name <your-binary-name>
```

#### go install

Requires Go 1.25 or newer (older toolchains fetch it automatically unless
`GOTOOLCHAIN=local` is set):

```bash
go install github.com/ZviBaratz/atrium@latest
```

#### Updating

```bash
atrium update          # download, verify, and install the latest release
atrium update --check  # just see whether one exists
```

Atrium also checks for new releases when it starts (cached: the network is
hit at most once a day, and at most once an hour after a failed check) and
shows a hint when one is available. The running app and your sessions are
never touched — an installed update takes effect the next time you start
`atrium`. Set `"auto_update": "auto"` in `config.json` to install updates
automatically in the background (auto mode may also check at startup while a
found update is still pending install), or `"off"` to disable the startup
check.
Source builds that are not at an exact release tag (`go install`, dev
checkouts) report a dev version and never self-update.

#### Keybindings

Press `?` in the app for the same cheatsheet, live. This table mirrors it group
for group; a test (`keys.TestReadmeDocumentsEveryBinding`) fails the build if the
in-app keymap and this section ever drift apart, so it stays complete.

#### Filtering

Press `/` to filter the session list incrementally. A query is split on
whitespace into terms combined with **AND**; each term is either a predicate over
cached session state or a plain substring matched (case-insensitively) against a
session's name, branch, or note. Predicate values match by **prefix**, so the
list narrows as you type rather than blinking empty mid-word.

| Term | Matches |
|------|---------|
| `status:<name>` | sessions whose status prefixes `<name>` — `running`, `ready`, `loading`, `paused`, `needsinput`, `pending` |
| `dirty` | sessions with uncommitted changes |
| `behind` | sessions behind their base branch |
| `behind:<expr>` | `behind:3` (exactly 3), `behind:>0`, `behind:>=2`, `behind:<5`, `behind:<=1` |
| `pr:<state>` | PR state prefixing `<state>` — `open`, `merged`, `closed`, or `none` (no PR) |
| `account:<name>` | Claude account name prefixing `<name>`; `account:none` for sessions with no resolved account |
| `note:<text>` | sessions whose note prefixes `<text>` |
| `<text>` | plain substring in the session's name, branch, or note |

Worked examples (each is exercised verbatim against the parser by
`session.TestReadmeFilterExamples`):

- `status:need dirty` — sessions that need input **and** have uncommitted changes.
- `behind:>0 pr:open` — sessions behind their base **and** with an open PR.
- `account:work note:release` — `work`-account sessions whose note starts with `release`.
- `auth` — any session with `auth` in its name, branch, or note.

Press `esc` to clear the committed filter.

##### Mouse
The mouse mirrors the keyboard — every click runs the same action its key would, nothing is mouse-only:

- **Click** a session row to select it, a repo header to fold/unfold it, a tab to switch to it, or any **hint-bar entry** to run that key.
- **Double-click** a session row to attach (like `↵`).
- **Wheel** over the list moves the selection; over a pane it scrolls that pane.
- **Drag** the divider between the list and the preview to resize the split.
- **Shift+drag** bypasses capture and selects text with your terminal's own selection — the escape hatch when you want to copy from the screen.

Set `mouse` to `false` to turn mouse capture off completely, handing every mouse event back to the terminal (see below).

### Configuration

Atrium stores its configuration in `~/.atrium/config.json`. You can find the exact path by running `atrium debug`. Installs that predate the rename keep using their existing `~/.claude-squad` directory automatically.

#### Mouse

Mouse capture is on by default: clickable session rows, repo headers, tabs, and hint-bar entries; wheel scrolling; and a draggable list/preview divider. If your terminal's native select-to-copy matters more than in-app clicking, hold **Shift** while dragging to select text past the capture, or turn the mouse off entirely:

```json
{
  "mouse": false
}
```

With `mouse` off, Atrium never enables mouse reporting, so selection, copy, and paste behave exactly as they would in any non-mouse program. The setting is also togglable live from the Settings panel (`,`).

#### Auto-attach

By default, Atrium attaches you to a new session as soon as it starts, so you land directly in the agent. Detach with `ctrl-q` to return to the session list. When you create a session with the `N` form and provide an initial prompt, auto-attach is skipped — the session stays in the list so the prompt is delivered automatically once the agent is ready, and you can attach with `↵`/`o` whenever you like.

To disable auto-attach and always return to the list after creating a session, set `auto_attach` to `false`:

```json
{
  "auto_attach": false
}
```

#### Auto-update

`auto_update` controls the startup release check: `"notify"` (default) shows a
hint when a newer release exists, `"auto"` downloads and installs it in the
background (applied on the next launch), and `"off"` disables the check. The
explicit `atrium update` command works regardless of this setting. Alongside
the transient hint, a persistent `⇡` badge in the Sessions panel border shows
the pending update (or restart) state until the next launch.

#### Notifications

Because each agent runs inside Atrium's own tmux server, an agent's own terminal
bell never reaches you — so Atrium can emit its own signal when a **background**
session finishes a turn or blocks on a prompt. `notifications` selects how:

- `"off"` (default) — no notifications.
- `"bell"` — rings the terminal bell once per edge on Atrium's own terminal.
- `"desktop"` — fires a desktop notification. With `notify_command` unset, Atrium
  uses a built-in per-OS notifier (`notify-send` on Linux, `terminal-notifier` or
  `osascript` on macOS); a missing notifier is a silent no-op.

The session you're currently on — the selected row, or one you're attached to —
never notifies, so only agents you've navigated away from can interrupt you.

```json
{
  "notifications": "desktop",
  "notify_command": "notify-send \"Atrium\" \"$ATRIUM_SESSION $ATRIUM_STATUS\""
}
```

`notify_command`, when set, runs via `sh -c` for each desktop notification with
`$ATRIUM_SESSION` (the session's display name), `$ATRIUM_STATUS`
(`Ready`/`NeedsInput`), and `$ATRIUM_EVENT` (`finished`/`needs_input`) in its
environment — the session name rides in the environment, never interpolated into
the command, so it can't break argument parsing. Use it for `terminal-notifier`,
webhooks (`curl`), or any custom notifier. A failing command is logged, never
fatal. Both settings are also editable live from the Settings panel (`,`).

#### Clipboard

Copy actions (`y` for the branch name, and hint mode's `f` copy) use **two
paths** so a copy lands in your local clipboard whether Atrium runs on your
machine or on a remote host:

- **OSC 52** — Atrium emits the copied text to your terminal as a clipboard
  escape sequence. This is the SSH-friendly path: it needs no clipboard binary
  on the remote, so a copy from an agent running over SSH still reaches the
  clipboard of the terminal in front of you. Your terminal must support (and
  usually enable) OSC 52 clipboard writes.
- **System clipboard utility** — Atrium also shells out to `xclip`/`xsel`/
  `wl-copy` (Linux), `pbcopy` (macOS), or the Windows clipboard. This is the
  local fallback for terminals that ignore OSC 52.

A copy only reports failure when **both** paths are unavailable, and the message
names the next step (install a clipboard utility, or use a terminal with OSC 52
support).

> **Running Atrium inside your own outer tmux?** tmux swallows OSC 52 by default,
> so the escape never reaches your terminal. Enable clipboard passthrough in that
> **outer** tmux (the one you started before launching Atrium):
>
> ```tmux
> # ~/.tmux.conf
> set -g set-clipboard on
> ```
>
> This applies only to an outer tmux you control — Atrium's own per-session tmux
> server is internal and already handled.

#### OS chrome (window title & taskbar progress)

When Atrium is one tab or window among many, its signal otherwise stops at its own
panel borders. With `os_chrome` on (the default), Atrium surfaces the fleet in the
terminal's own chrome:

- **Window title** — `atrium · 2 need you · 5 running`, updated as statuses change
  (zero segments are omitted; a fully idle fleet is a bare `atrium`).
- **Taskbar progress** (OSC 9;4) — an indeterminate bar while any agent is working,
  cleared when none are, and an error state when a session dies. Rendered by
  Ghostty 1.2+, Windows Terminal, ConEmu, and kitty; other terminals ignore it.

Set `os_chrome` to `false` when your shell or multiplexer owns the title:

```json
{
  "os_chrome": false
}
```

Also editable live from the Settings panel (`,`).

#### Profiles

Profiles let you define multiple named program configurations and switch between them when creating a new session. When more than one profile is defined, the session creation overlay shows a profile picker that you can navigate with `←`/`→`.

On first run, Atrium probes for installed agent CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `aider`) and seeds a profile for each one it finds. After installing a new agent, run:

```bash
atrium profiles detect
```

to add it as a profile — existing profiles and your default program are never modified.

To configure profiles by hand, add a `profiles` array to your config file and set `default_program` to the name of the profile to select by default:

```json
{
  "default_program": "claude",
  "profiles": [
    { "name": "claude", "program": "claude" },
    { "name": "codex", "program": "codex" },
    { "name": "aider", "program": "aider --model ollama_chat/gemma3:1b" }
  ]
}
```

Each profile has two fields:

| Field     | Description                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`    | Display name shown in the profile picker                 |
| `program` | Shell command used to launch the agent for that profile  |

If no profiles are defined, Atrium uses `default_program` directly as the launch command (the default is `claude`).

#### Carried files

Git worktrees materialize only tracked files, so gitignored local config — most
commonly `.claude/settings.local.json` (hooks, output style, MCP allowlists) —
never reaches a fresh session worktree on its own. The `carry_files` list names
repo-relative gitignored files that Atrium copies from the original checkout
into each newly created session worktree:

```json
{
  "carry_files": [".claude/settings.local.json"]
}
```

The default is `[".claude/settings.local.json"]`; set an empty list (`[]`) to
opt out. Entries must be gitignored in the project — anything else is skipped
with a warning, because pausing a session commits its worktree and a
non-ignored file would leak into the session branch.

Carried files are re-seeded from the original checkout whenever the worktree
is created, including on resume after a pause — edits made to them inside a
session do not survive a pause/resume cycle.

#### Claude accounts

Route each session to a specific Claude Code account by injecting a per-session
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, chosen by matching the worktree's git `origin` remote (or, for
a non-git/direct session, its directory path). This is useful when different repos
must run under different Claude accounts (e.g. personal vs. work), since MCP
connectors and auth are stored per `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Add a `claude_accounts`
list to your config file:

```json
{
  "claude_accounts": [
    { "name": "personal", "config_dir": "~/.claude" },
    {
      "name": "quantivly",
      "config_dir": "~/.claude-quantivly",
      "remote_matches": ["quantivly/", "github-quantivly:"],
      "path_matches": ["/quantivly/"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `remote_matches` are case-insensitive substrings tested against the origin URL.
- `path_matches` are case-insensitive substrings tested against the target
  **directory path** — the routing signal for **direct (non-git) sessions** (which
  have no remote), such as a container directory that holds several repos but is not
  itself one, and also a route for git repos whose remote matches nothing.
- Matching is evaluated per account in list order (within an account, remote first
  then path); the first account that hits either rule wins. Because list order
  dominates, an earlier account's `path_matches` beats a later account's
  `remote_matches`.
- The **first account with no `remote_matches` and no `path_matches`** is the
  catch-all default, used when no route matches. It is optional: with no such
  account, non-matching sessions inherit the current environment.
- The resolved account is **pinned at session creation** and shown as a badge in
  the session list (dim for the default account, accented for a routed one). It
  is injected once at launch and is not re-resolved on restart or `--continue`;
  editing `claude_accounts` affects only newly created sessions.
- When more than one account is configured, the new-session form shows an
  **Account** picker, preset to the auto-routed account, to override the choice.
- Omitting `claude_accounts` disables the feature entirely (no badge, no
  injection), so existing configs are unaffected.

#### GitHub CLI accounts

`gh` keeps a single **global active account** per host, so in a multi-agent setup a
session on a work repo and a session on a personal repo fight over it — and an agent
running `gh auth switch` to fix its own auth silently breaks every other running
session. Atrium avoids this by injecting a per-session `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, chosen by the
same remote/path matching as `claude_accounts` but configured independently so gh
routing can differ from Claude-login routing. Add a `gh_accounts` list:

```json
{
  "gh_accounts": [
    { "name": "personal", "config_dir": "~/.config/gh" },
    {
      "name": "quantivly",
      "config_dir": "~/.config/gh-quantivly",
      "remote_matches": ["quantivly/", "github-quantivly:"],
      "path_matches": ["/quantivly/"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `config_dir` is a `gh` config directory (containing `hosts.yml`) whose **active
  account** is the one you want for matching repos. Create one per account, e.g.
  `GH_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gh-quantivly gh auth login`; when `gh` stores tokens in the
  OS keyring, the separate dirs share those tokens and differ only in which account is
  active. Verify with `GH_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gh-quantivly gh auth status`.
- Matching rules (`remote_matches`, `path_matches`, list order, the optional rule-less
  catch-all) work exactly as for `claude_accounts` above.
- The resolved dir is injected into the agent's tmux session (so the agent's own `gh`
  — and any HTTPS git credential-helper — pick the right account) **and** into
  Atrium's own `gh` calls (PR create/merge/view). It is pinned at session creation;
  editing `gh_accounts` affects only newly created sessions.
- Omitting `gh_accounts` (or a non-matching session with no catch-all) leaves `gh` on
  its ambient global account, exactly as before.

> **Commit identity & SSH keys are still handled outside Atrium.** `gh_accounts`
> routes the *GitHub CLI account* (`GH_CONFIG_DIR`) and `claude_accounts` routes the
> *Claude Code account* (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`); neither sets git commit identity.

#### Configuration reference

Every `config.json` key, its default, and where it is documented above. Most are
also editable live from the Settings panel (`,`); the three marked **†** are
JSON-only and have no Settings row. A test
(`config.TestReadmeDocumentsEveryConfigField`) fails the build if a new field is
added without a row here.

### FAQs

#### Failed to start new session

If you get an error like `failed to start new session: timed out waiting for tmux session`, update the
underlying program (ex. `claude`) to the latest version.

### Security & verifying releases

Releases ship with SLSA build provenance and a keyless Sigstore signature over
the checksums file, plus a per-archive SBOM. To confirm a download is genuine:

```bash
gh attestation verify atrium_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz --repo ZviBaratz/atrium
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full verification steps (including `cosign`)
and how to report a vulnerability privately.

### How It Works
