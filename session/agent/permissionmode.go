// subset deliberately excludes bypassPermissions — its startup acceptance
// dialog ("WARNING… Yes, I accept") would block the session boot, and a user
// who wants it can pin it in a profile program — and dontAsk, the
// non-interactive CI mode that auto-denies anything not allowlisted. The

// pins that relation so a chip added to one list but not the other cannot turn
// into a submit-time "invalid permission mode" error on a UI-offered chip.

// claudePermissionModeMarkers maps a stable footer token to the enum value of
// the mode it indicates. The tokens are the mode-name words claude renders in
// its status-bar line below the input box — every one captured verbatim from a
// live pane (see permissionmode_detect_test.go fixtures). The cycle and dontAsk
// were captured at 2.1.209 (#333) and re-confirmed at 2.1.210 (#332):
//
//	⏸ manual mode on · ? for shortcuts · ← for agents
//	⏸ plan mode on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← for agents
//	⏵⏵ accept edits on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← for agents
//	⏵⏵ auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← for agents
//	⏵⏵ don't ask on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← for agents
//
// dontAsk is a one-way door — shift+tab cycles out of it but the cycle
// (default → acceptEdits → plan → auto) never returns, so it is reachable only
// by pinning the flag, which a profile program can do. It still advertises the
// cycle chord, which is why its footer is not the shape a reading of the mode
// table alone would predict.
//
// bypassPermissions was the last token with no live evidence — reaching it means
// accepting the "you accept all responsibility" startup dialog, which Atrium
// does not drive. #332 drove it once by hand (throwaway dir, footer captured,
// no prompt ever sent) and the line the bundle's mode table implied turned out
// to be exactly right, at 2.1.210:
//
//	⏵⏵ bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← for agents
//
// Note what that does and does not settle. It confirms this token; it does not
// license predicting the next footer from the table — dontAsk above is the
// standing counter-example, where the same reasoning produced the wrong line.
//
// Every mode holds its indicator for the whole turn, busy or idle; only the
// hint beside it swaps. Since the mode is cyclable mid-turn, that persistence is
// what lets a busy footer track a switch instead of stalling on the pre-turn
// value.
//
// Matching the words, not the leading glyph, keeps detection robust to a glyph
// restyle and is what disambiguates at all: ⏸ covers both default and plan, and
// ⏵⏵ covers the other four, so the glyph alone names nothing. The table must
// stay exhaustive over the modes that render an indicator: an unlisted mode
// whose footer also carries the "? for shortcuts" hint would fall through to the
// check below and be misreported as "default" rather than merely go unknown —
// default's own footer is the proof those two can co-occur. A footer no token
// here names yields known=false, which for a claude session now consults the
// hook record's permission_mode before falling back to the pinned flag
// (tmux.Session.Poll's arbitration, #324).

// claudePermissionMode reports the permission mode shown in the live pane
// footer. known=false (mode "") means the footer is indeterminate — it names no
// mode and shows no idle shortcuts hint, or the capture is startup/degenerate —
// so the caller keeps its last known value rather than flicker.
//
// Current claude names the default mode like any other, as "⏸ manual mode on",
// so the marker table recognizes it directly, and reporting it as a real
// "default" lets the chip clear when a session is switched back to normal. The
// "? for shortcuts" fall-through below the loop is what remains of an older
// contract: the 2.1.178-era CLI rendered no mode line for default, and the idle
// hint was the only thing that named it. The changeover landed somewhere in
// (2.1.178, 2.1.206] — 2.1.206 already renders the indicator, so every version
// Atrium has verified against does, up to and including the VerifiedVersion pin.
// Keeping the fall-through keeps detection working against a CLI older than
// that; it is no longer the sole detector for the mode, which matters because
// "? for shortcuts" is not about the mode at all — the footer pushes it only as
// a fallback, when no other hint applies, so a busy turn shows the interrupt
// hint in its place (live 2.1.210, at any width). Keying a mode off it was
// always keying off something that is not about the mode.
//
// #333 described that hint area as a single mutually-exclusive slot selected by
// state (interrupt / ctrl_t / agents / voice / shortcuts). The #332 sweep found
// that reading came from the wrong branch: the bundle has two footer
// implementations behind the remote gate `tengu_copper_thistle`, and the
// single-slot one is the *gated* branch. What we render is the ungated branch,
// which builds a hint LIST — hints concatenate, and "? for shortcuts" is pushed
// only when that list is otherwise empty. The live proof is co-occurrence the
// single-slot branch cannot produce: "⏸ manual mode on · ? for shortcuts · ←
// for agents" (2.1.210) carries the shortcuts hint and the agents hint at once.
// Detection is unaffected — both branches render "<label> on" — but note that a
// remote gate can swap this shape with no version change, which VerifiedVersion
// cannot express.
//
// Detection is confined to footerBelowBox — the live chrome below the input
// box's bottom border — so a mode phrase quoted in the scrolled-back transcript
// can never false-match. Crucially it gates on the box border being present:
// with no border on screen (a busy frame whose box is hidden, a pre-box startup
// capture) the bottom lines can't be proven to be live chrome rather than
// transcript, so detection stays indeterminate and the caller keeps its last
// value rather than trust a phrase that may be conversation text.
