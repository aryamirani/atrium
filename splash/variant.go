package splash

// The splash variant vocabulary and per-variant Pass-2 policy: which field
// generators exist, what users call them, and how each shades. Selection (which
// variant is active) and the dev-only ATRIUM_SPLASH_* env overrides live in
// package ui, which drives this package through Render. Kept apart from field.go
// so that file is only the noise core and the renderer — this is the part that
// changes whenever a variant is added, retired, or renamed.

// Variant selects the field generator + glyph technique. Package ui pins one
// (or keeps a random per-launch rotation) and passes it in through Options; the
// dev-only ATRIUM_SPLASH_VARIANT override, also resolved in ui, can trump that.

	// own to spend (see buildRainRamp).

	// lookup becomes an infinite corridor. The roster's depth entry — z-fog
	// carries distance in luminance, and hue bands by depth into coloured rings
	// receding down the wall.
	Tunnel
	// Ripple ("h") is drops falling on a dark pool: each one flashes where it
	// lands and expands into a ring that shifts hue as it ages, and the rings
	// interfere where they cross. The roster's event entry — the only field with
	// a birth and a death in it rather than a steady state.

// variant that wants one re-adds it with its own justification, which is healthier
// than inheriting an unowned one: this package has already shipped that bug, with
// dimToRim declared and never read, so rain silently took a 42% dim it had opted

	// all brightness in the colour, which is the only thing that works when the
	// glyph vocabulary has no light end to fade into. Between them the two channels
	// split it, so density can carry texture while luminance carries brightness.
