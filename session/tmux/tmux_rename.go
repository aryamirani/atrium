// Rename renames the live tmux session to newSessionName and its window to

// derivation (the instance layer mints repo-qualified names); this method never
// derives. The write lock is held across the rename-session subprocess AND the
// field swap, so a concurrent reader (the metadata poll loop) never observes
// the brief window where the old session name no longer exists — which would
// otherwise read as a "lost session". If the session isn't live (e.g. paused
// after a reboot) it updates the cached names only, so a later restore targets
// the new name.
