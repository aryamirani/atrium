// The splash field generator: deterministic noise primitives and the two-pass
// renderer built on them. Pass 1 evaluates the raw (pre-contrast) scalar field
// into a buffer; Pass 2 applies the contrast curve, the edge vignette, glyph
// and color quantization, the starfield, and emits run-coalesced ANSI.
// Everything is free of time/rand dependence so Render stays pure and
// snapshot-testable — animation enters only through the frame counter.
//
// The gradient LUT lives in lut.go and the variant vocabulary in variant.go;
// this file owns the field math, the per-cell loops, and the Render entrypoint.

	// every cell pays its own SGR bracket. Seeded at 4 the Builder doubled twice
